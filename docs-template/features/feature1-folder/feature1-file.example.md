# Database Connections Management

The Database Connections Management feature enables users to securely store and manage their database connection details. It provides a safe and efficient way to connect to different databases without exposing sensitive credentials while maintaining easy access for authorized users.

## High Level Requirements

The system should provide secure and user-friendly management of database connections with comprehensive security measures and testing capabilities.

### Functional Requirements
Connection Management
   - Users can add new database connections
   - Users can edit existing connections
   - Users can delete connections
   - Users can view a list of available connections
   - Support for PostgreSQL databases (MVP)

Connection Testing
   - Ability to test connection before saving
   - Basic connection health checks
   - Connection status monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements
Security
   - Secure storage of connection credentials
   - Encrypted communication with databases
   - Access control based on user permissions

Performance
   - Connection testing response within 5 seconds
   - Support for multiple simultaneous connections
   - Minimal latency in connection management operations

## Solution Overview

The feature implements secure database connection management through three main components, each handling specific aspects of the functionality.

### [DataHubAPI](../../architecture.example.md#datahubapi)
Serves as the core backend component handling all connection-related operations:
- Processes CRUD operations for database connections through RESTful endpoints
- Implements credential encryption/decryption using industry-standard algorithms
- Performs connection testing and validation before saving
- Enforces role-based access control for connection management
- Monitors connection health through periodic checks
- Detailed API specifications available in [API Specification](DataHubAPI.md)

### [DataHubWeb](../../architecture.example.md#datahubweb)
Provides the user interface layer with responsive and intuitive controls:
- Displays paginated connection list with search and filter capabilities
- Offers intuitive forms for connection creation and modification
- Shows real-time connection status indicators
- Implements permission management interface
- Provides immediate feedback on connection test results

### [DataHubDB](../../architecture.example.md#datahubdb)
Manages persistent storage of connection data with security measures:
- Maintains the `database_connections` table for storing encrypted connection details
- Implements audit logging for connection management operations
- Handles metadata storage for connection monitoring
- Complete database schema available in [DB Specification](DataHubDB.md)

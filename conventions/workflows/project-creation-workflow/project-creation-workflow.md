# Project Scaffolding Sprint Workflow Chain: AI-Assisted Planning and Implementation

## Overview

**Note: This workflow is designed for projects that are in the initial scaffolding phase. It assumes no prior project structure, dependencies, or core technologies are in place.**

This workflow represents a chained sequence of AI-assisted processes for planning and implementing the initial project scaffolding. Each phase produces specific outputs that become required inputs for subsequent phases, creating a connected chain of development activities.

The workflow operates through the following sequential phases:

```
Phase 1: Vision Statement Generation
Phase 2: Initial Project Requirements Management
Phase 3: Technology Stack Generation
Phase 4: Architecture Design Generation
Phase 5: Scaffolding Sprint Story Generation
Phase 6: Story Analysis
Phase 7A: Implementation
Phase 7B: Unit Testing
```


## Phase 1: Vision Statement Generation (`#generate-vision`)
[Vision Statement Generation Prompt](../../workflows-prompts/assistant-specific/cursor/phase-1-project-vision.md)
#### Purpose
Define a comprehensive project vision statement that aligns with project requirements.

**Initial Inputs Required:**
- Project idea or problem statement

**Key Outputs → [Feed into Phase 2]:**
- Vision Statement Document (`project_vision.md`)

## Phase 2: Initial Project Requirements Management (`#generate-requirements`)


## Result
As the result of this workflow following structure should be created:

```

├── [component1]/
│   ├── core files
│   └── tests
├── [component2]/
│   ├── core files
│   └── tests
└── shared/
